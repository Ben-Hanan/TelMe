**Proposed level of achievement: Apollo 11**

**Motivation **

It’s that time of the year again, your Telco subscription is up for renewal and you’re faced with a tough decision, to recontract or to change Telco? A quick google search for the best mobile recontract promotions ends up being a 1 hour search for the best deal possible. You finally decide to recontract with Singtel, but to your dismay, after going through all that hassle, you find out that M1 was offering way more mobile data capacity for lower prices. 

 

In this day and age, information is key. However, in a bid to attract more customers, companies flood and overwhelm the market with ambiguous and irrelevant advertisements. This discourages many to do more research and choose the easiest but less worth it option. 

The issue of how fast information can be acquired also comes into play. Sifting through multiple websites is extremely time consuming and users cannot look up promotions they did not even know exists. Hence, a single place where users can view and sort through all kinds of Telco subscription plans and promotions is needed.

 

**Aim **

We hope to be able to provide users with a single place where one can view and compare all the different types of Telco subscription plans and promotions. Here, they will be able to find the best available Telco subscription plan, tailor made, according to what they are looking for.

**Recommending Plans**

We used K-means clustering as a machine learning model that made use of user similarity in order to provide better plan recommendations. When a user saves a particular plan into his favorites list, the backend triggers the machine learning model and allocates him to a cluster with users of similar profiles. The backend will then suggest favorited plans of these similar users to the current user. As such, our model will perform better with more user activity.

We chose K-means clustering because It is a fast clustering algorithm that has parallel and scalable implementations (e.g. see [Spark](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/mllib-clustering.html)). And overall, it is very easy to understand what K-means does and how it works. A user cluster is just a group of users close to each other based on how they favorited plans. 

**Web Extraction**

As of milestone 2 we have managed to come up with a basic web scraper that scrapes plans from starhub's website. Beautiful soup was used to crawl through the html of the webpage and the data was pipelined into the django product model we created to populate our database. As of now, the scraper is run manually using the command ‘python starhubscraper.py’.

For milestone 3, we plan to explore dynamic web page web scraping and scrape data from all telco websites to provide a robust variety of different telco plans to our database. We also plan to automate the scraping process once we host our website online.
